# ESP8266DHT22ProtoVer1


So the current progress is that the ESP8266 can display the Temperature, Humidity, and Heat Index.

Things to update and make:
- Recorded Temp, Humid, Index must be recorded in a Database
- Make a connection/API using PHP
- Experiment the time module (to be added, module not yet obtained)

*notes*
- This is an ESP8266, the project that was proposed will utilize ESP32, so parts must be observed
